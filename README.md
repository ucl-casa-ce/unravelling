# Unravelling :iphone: :yarn:

Explore the relationship between textile technologies and WebAR

## About

_Unravelling_ explores the relationship between textile technologies, as a tactile means of making and marking time in isolation, and web-based technologies, as means of communicating and experiencing intimacy without touch.

_Unravelling_ takes part during the [_Out of Touch: A Festival of Intimacy_](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/culture/whats-on/festival-intimacy) (Sat 19 June 2021), a day-long festival of intimate performances, conversations and interactions that responds to the themes of touch and intimacy, and asks what intimacy has meant whilst living through the Covid19 pandemic. 

Contributing work will be created by artists, UCL students and academics, and the event will take place across UCLâ€™s Bloomsbury Theatre, Grant Museum, Petrie Museum and a variety of outdoor spaces in between.

# Tools

## Create the AR Markers

The folder _./markergen_ contains the scripts to create the pattern _.patt_ used by _AR.Js_. It is based on the [AR.js marker-training](https://github.com/AR-js-org/AR.js/tree/master/three.js/examples/marker-training). After installing the _node_modules_ using `npm install` these are the steps to follow:

- copy the images to convert into Pattern file in the _./markergen/img_ folder (images need to be square, PNG -with no alpha- or JPG);
- in a new `node.js` terminal, in the _./markergen_ folder run `node generator`;
- the patterns will be created and saved in the folder _./markergen/patt_

## Setup the AR Experience

The content of the AR experience is controlled by the _index.json_. The JSON contain an array of Objects and it has the following structure:

```
{
    "info": {
      "version": "1.0",
      "title": "unravelling",
      "markers":6
    },
    "content": [
      {
        "markerName": "patt_marker_1",
        "contentName": "Text.glb",
        "type":"model",
        "titleContent": " The Content 1"
      },
      {
        [other marker]
      },
      {
        "markerName": "patt_marker_x",
        "contentName": "content_x.jpg",
        "type":"image",
        "titleContent": "The Content x"
      }
    ]
  }
```

- _markerName_: filename of the pattern exported from the generator, without extension
- _contentName_: filename of the content __with__ extension, possible options are:
  - JPG for images
  - MP3 for sounds
  - GLB for 3D models
- _type_: type of content to visualise, it is used to create the right Aframe entity
  - image
  - model
  - sound
- _titleContent_: text created using an AFrame text entity. Leave empty if none

All the media files need to be stored in the folder _./resources/content_ together with the _index.json_. All the pattern files _.patt_ need to be stored in the folder _./resources/patt_

## Notes

- the camera in _AR.Js_ needs a frame around the image to be recognised. In this project we used a cut-out 9 by 9 cm with border 1.7cm thick (internal area avaiable for the image 5.8 by 5.8). PatternRatio to set in the _index.html_ is 0.64;
- if instead of printed images the marker are actual objects (like in this project, where we used textile squares) a well lit surface is needed to help in the detection. In addition, not all the orientations would be easily detected by the camera.
