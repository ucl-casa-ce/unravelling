Explore the relationship between textile technologies and WebAR

## About

_Unravelling_ explores the relationship between textile technologies, as a tactile means of makingand marking time in isolation, and web-based technologies, as means of communicating and experiencing intimacy without touch.

_Unravelling_ takes part during the [_Out of Touch: A Festival of Intimacy_](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/culture/news/festival-intimacy-open-call#:~:text=Out%20of%20Touch%3A%20A%20Festival%20of%20Intimacy%20is%20a%20day,living%20through%20the%20Covid19%20pandemic.&text=The%20Festival%20is%20due%20to%20take%20place%20on%20Sat%2019%20June%202021) (Sat 19 June 2021), a day-long festival of intimate performances, conversations and interactions that responds to the themes of touch and intimacy, and asks what intimacy has meant whilst living through the Covid19 pandemic. 

Contributing work will be created by artists, UCL students and academics, and the event will take place across UCLâ€™s Bloomsbury Theatre, Grant Museum, Petrie Museum and a variety of outdoor spaces in between.
